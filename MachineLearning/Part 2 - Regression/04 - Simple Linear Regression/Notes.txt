======== Part 4: Simple Linear Regression ========

-- 4.28

Simple Linear Regression Formula:

  y = b0 + (b1 * x1)

      y     => Dependent Variable (DV)
      x1    => Independent Variable (IV)
      b1    => Coefficient (How a unit change in x1 results in a change in y)
      b0    => Constant

  In our sample data set, we would end up with a base formula looking like:

    Salary = b0 + (b1*Experience)

To get a line of best fit, we would need to compare our actual observations to
what we observed from our model.

We label our actual observation as Yi, and our expected to be Yî.

To get the best fitting line we do:

  SUM(Yi - Yî)^2

    Which in essence takes the distance(difference) between the actual and
    expected values, then take the summation of each value squared.
