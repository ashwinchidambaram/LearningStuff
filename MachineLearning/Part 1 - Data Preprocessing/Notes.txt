Part 1: Data Preprocessing Notes

-- 2.15

We need to always remember the difference between the independent and dependent variables. Always using the independent variables to predict the dependent variables.

-- 2.16

Import the following libraries which are generally used:

  import numpy as np
      ## numpy is used to perform any mathematical function in python and and create alias 'np' to make it easy to refer to

  import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
      ## matplotlib.pyplot (matplotlib is main library, pyplot is sublibrary)

  import pandas as pd
      ## pandas library is best to import and manage data sets

-- 2.17
To store/read a dataset:

  dataset = pd.read_csv('DATASET_NAME')

To separate data into Dependent/Independent Variables:

  X = dataset.iloc[a, b].values
  Y = dataset.iloc[c, d].values

    ## Where a, c represent the lines/rows to be read; Where b, d represent the columns to be read
    ## By using ':' it signifies all, and we can restrict by doing ':-x' or 'x' where x is some number
