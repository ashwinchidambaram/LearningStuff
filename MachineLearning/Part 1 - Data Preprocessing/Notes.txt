Part 1: Data Preprocessing Notes

-- 2.15

We need to always remember the difference between the independent and dependent variables. Always using the independent variables to predict the dependent variables.

Import the following libraries which are generally used:

  import numpy as np
      ## numpy is used to perform any mathematical function in python and and create alias 'np' to make it easy to refer to

  import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
      ## matplotlib.pyplot (matplotlib is main library, pyplot is sublibrary)

  import pandas as pd
      ## pandas library is best to import and manage data sets

-- 2.17
To store/read a dataset:

  dataset = pd.read_csv('DATASET_NAME')

To separate data into Dependent/Independent Variables:

  X = dataset.iloc[a, b].values
  Y = dataset.iloc[c, d].values

    ## Where a, c represent the lines/rows to be read; Where b, d represent the columns to be read
    ## By using ':' it signifies all, and we can restrict by doing ':-x' or 'x' where x is some number

A class is the model of something we want to build. For example, if we make a house construction plan that gathers the instructions on how to build a house, then this construction plan is the class.

An object is an instance of the class. So if we take that same example of the house construction plan, then an object is simply a house. A house (the object) that was built by following the instructions of the construction plan (the class).
And therefore there can be many objects of the same class, because we can build many houses from the construction plan.

A method is a tool we can use on the object to complete a specific action. So in this same example, a tool can be to open the main door of the house if a guest is coming. A method can also be seen as a function that is applied onto the object, takes some inputs (that were defined in the class) and returns some output.
