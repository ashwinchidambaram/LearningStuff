Indexing Strings: Present at the same time but have diff applications
- Normal Indexing goes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 ...
- Reverse Indexing goes: ... -4, -3, -2, -1

Subsection of a string from position x to the end: 			[x:]
Subsection from the beginning up to position x (Does not include x):	[:x]
To get a subsection from x to y:					[x:y]
To get step sizes (z) of an index:					[::z]
If we wanted to specify a start(x) and stop(y) with a step(z):		[x:y:z]
To reverse a string, its easy to reverse step it:			[::-1]

Assuming string x
---
To make all uppercase: 							x.upper()
To make all lowercase:							x.lower()
To split a string into a list: 						x.split()
To split a string based on a char:					x.split('z')
